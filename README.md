# Digital Will NFT: Your Secure FHE-Encrypted Inheritance Solution

The Digital Will NFT project transforms the concept of legacy into the digital realm by creating NFTs that represent FHE-encrypted "digital wills". Powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**, this innovative solution ensures that your personal wishes regarding digital asset distribution remain confidential until they are needed, thereby safeguarding the sensitive nature of your intent.

## The Challenge of Digital Inheritance

As our digital lives become increasingly complex, so too do the challenges surrounding the management of digital assets upon a person's passing. Family members might struggle with accessing and managing these assets without clear instructions, leading to disputes, emotional distress, and potential financial loss. Traditional legal frameworks often fall short in adequately addressing these digital legacy issues, making the need for a secure, privacy-focused solution more pressing than ever.

## How FHE Provides a Solution

Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology offers a groundbreaking solution to the challenges of digital inheritance. By encrypting a user's final wishes and asset allocations directly into an NFT, this project guarantees that only approved heirs can gain access to this critical information once a verified death certificate is presented. This approach utilizes **Zama's open-source libraries**—including **Concrete**, **TFHE-rs**, and the **zama-fhe SDK**—to ensure that sensitive data remains completely private, allowing users to maintain control over their digital legacy in a secure manner.

## Key Features

- **FHE-Encrypted Digital Will:** Create an NFT that serves as a secure representation of your digital will, encrypted to ensure privacy until needed.
- **Soul-Bound NFT:** The digital will becomes a soul-bound NFT that links uniquely to the user, making it tamper-proof and strictly personal.
- **Heir Access Control:** Only authorized heirs can decrypt the will, ensuring that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access.
- **Seamless Integration with Web3 Assets:** Securely link your personal wishes with your digital assets in the Web3 ecosystem.
- **Comprehensive Inheritance Management:** Provides a user-friendly interface for managing wills and designated heirs, ensuring clarity in digital inheritance processes.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK:** The backbone of confidentiality and encryption.
- **Solidity:** Smart contract programming for the NFT.
- **Node.js:** Server-side runtime for package management.
- **Hardhat:** Development environment for smart contract deployment.
- **IPFS:** Optional for decentralized storage of metadata (can be integrated upon user preference).

## Directory Structure

Here's how the project is organized:

```
/digitalWillNFT_FHE
├── contracts
│   ├── digitalWillNFT_FHE.sol
├── scripts
│   ├── deploy.js
│   ├── mint.js
├── test
│   ├── digitalWillNFT_FHE.test.js
├── package.json
├── hardhat.config.js
```

## Installation Instructions

To get started with the Digital Will NFT project, please follow these steps:

1. **Ensure you have Node.js installed** on your system. You can download it from the official site.

2. **Install Hardhat:** If Hardhat is not installed, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev hardhat
   ```

3. **Download the project files** (do not use `git clone`).

4. **Navigate to the project directory** where you’ve placed the files.

5. **Install the required dependencies** by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will fetch the necessary Zama FHE libraries along with other dependencies.

## Build & Run Guide

To compile, test, and run the Digital Will NFT project, follow these commands:

1. **Compile the smart contracts:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run your tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the contracts to your desired network:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
   ```

4. **Mint an NFT for your digital will:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/mint.js --network <network_name>
   ```

## Example Code Snippet

Here’s a brief example of how the NFT can be minted, encapsulating the user's wishes securely:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract DigitalWillNFT is ERC721 {
    string public digitalWillData;

    constructor() ERC721("DigitalWillNFT", "DWNFT") {}

    function mintNFT(address to, string memory encryptedWill) public {
        uint256 tokenId = totalSupply() + 1; // Simple way to handle token IDs
        _mint(to, tokenId);
        digitalWillData = encryptedWill; // Store encrypted will data
    }

    // Additional functions for unlocking will can be added here
}
```

This code illustrates the creation of an NFT that encapsulates FHE-encrypted will data.
